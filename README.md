# Generic Wat

Implements basic-redux store logic, elixir-ish. More like a playground.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add gen_wat to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:gen_wat, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure gen_wat is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:gen_wat]]
        end
